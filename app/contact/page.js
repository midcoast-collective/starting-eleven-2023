                This project is a big undertaking for us balancing a players
                personal time and achieving high quality through the camera and
                story. Sometimes the equation doesn&apos;t favor us but
                that&apos;s what makes us the best at what we do. We know how to
                be in the players shoes and bring the best out of them.
